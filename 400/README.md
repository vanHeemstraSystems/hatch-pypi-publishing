# 400 - Conclusion

Handling multiple virtual environments for a single application can be difficult. Hatch, a popular Python project manager, helps you easily create and maintain different virtual environments for a single application with the help of a ```pyproject.toml``` file.

In this repository, you learned how to create, manage, and delete virtual environments using Hatch.

While Hatch offers features such as project management, dependency management, and environment management, it can’t handle system-level dependencies, which significantly impacts code reproducibility. While manually creating and managing environments can mitigate this issue, it’s cumbersome and challenging to maintain consistency across different systems. 

Thankfully, [Earthly](https://cloud.earthly.dev/login) can help streamline your development processes and resolve system-level dependencies with the help of a single Earthfile. This file can manage your Python dependencies and system-level dependencies all in one place while providing a step-by-step execution flow like Docker.
