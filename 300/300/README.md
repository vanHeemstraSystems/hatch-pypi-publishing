# 300 - Limitations of Virtual Environments with Hatch

While Hatch provides many benefits, there are a few limitations you need to be aware of:

- **Lack of system-level (non-Python) dependency management**: One of the major issues you’ll encounter when utilizing Hatch for multiple environments is the “[it works on my machine](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-eliminate-works-on-my-machine-issues/)” dilemma. Despite having identical Python dependencies in two environments, variations in non-Python dependencies can produce different results. This discrepancy is commonly observed with libraries like [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) that rely on system-level libraries for tasks such as image rendering. These system-level dependencies may vary across systems, resulting in inconsistencies.
- **Not suitable for extension modules**: Hatch lacks support for interfacing with interpreters or compilers, making it unsuitable for developing [Python extension modules](https://llllllllll.github.io/c-extension-tutorial/what-is-an-extension-module.html) that need direct interaction with interpreters. It’s recommended that you utilize configuration management tools such as [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) or other backends specifically designed for interfacing with compilers.
- **No support for patch release versions**: Hatch uses a minor release granularity that follows the most recent patch release. Currently, it doesn’t allow the installation of certain patch release versions. It’s recommended that you use a different installation method if you place a high value on a particular patch release.
