# 100 - What Is Hatch?

As an extensible Python project manager, Hatch can define versions, declare dependencies, and publish packages to PyPI via its [build backend](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) called [Hatchling](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/history/hatchling/). Unlike setuptools, Hatchling stands out in terms of configurability, reproducibility, and extensibility.

Additionally, while tools like tox and Nox require preinstalled Python versions, Hatch dynamically downloads required Python distributions on demand, thus ensuring seamless execution.

Thanks to Hatchâ€™s Python management capabilities, Hatch is cross-platform compatible, simplifies development workflows, and offers faster dependency installation when compared to venv and pyenv.
